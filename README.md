# safe-nav-locomotion

This repo contains the code used for implementation in our published work 
"Jonas Warnke*, Abdulaziz Shamsah*, Yingke Li*, and Ye Zhao. Towards Safe Locomotion Navigation in Partially Observable Environments with Uneven Terrain, (*equally contributed), IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), 2020."

The Drake directory contains the code nacessary to generate the center of mass, foot trajectories as well as foot placement location using phase-space planning. It also containts a Drake visualization code of the Cassie bipedal robot following the generated trajectories in the proposed environment.
