\begin{abstract}

We consider the problem of maximizing visibility coverage of an environment while satisfying a surveillance requirement, that is, maintain knowledge on the location of a potentially adversarial moving target. Using a level set representation of data and information, we train a convolutional neural network to determine vantage points that maximize visibility. While this method reduces online computation cost, it does not guarantee the surveillance requirement. We represent this requirement as a GR(1) temporal logic formula on a partial-information two player game and synthesize a permissive strategy.
