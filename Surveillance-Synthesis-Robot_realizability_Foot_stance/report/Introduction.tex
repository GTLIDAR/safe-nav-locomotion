\section{Introduction}

Want to do surveillance. However, it is also important to routinely observe parts of the map that haven't been seen in a while. We combine the two. 

\subsection{Related work}
Other surveillance work, some optimal exploration work. Maybe even some runtime monitoring work


\subsection{Contribution}
A framework to allow for patrolling of a map constrained by a the surveillance requirement on a hostile target. Comes with formal guarantees of correctness as well quantitative guarantees on surveillance. Also efficient exploration.
